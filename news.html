                A second win on the bounce for Max Verstappen in Miami, and while he still trails Charles Leclerc in the championship by 19 points, it looks as though he is just starting to lay down a marker.

The manner of Verstappen’s recent victories is what has been eye catching. In both Imola and Miami, it wasn’t just a lights to flag victory – he had to come from behind to overhaul Leclerc and did so quite comfortably.

                Verstappen slipped from provisional pole heading into the final runs of Q3 down to third on the grid, because he overcooked it over the Turn 5 apex kerb, amidst very high track evolution in Miami. He should have been close with Leclerc for pole at the very least, but ended up being shuffled to the second row.

The worry for Ferrari at the moment though must be the manner with which Verstappen is able to beat them, even when he starts behind both cars, and on a Miami circuit which the majority of the other drivers found tricky to overtake on without a significant tyre offset.
Verstappen didn’t rely on team tactics or strategy for the win either, he outmuscled Sainz at the first corner to immediately split the Ferraris. Sainz was a bit hampered by his inside line and being boxed in by Leclerc at the apex, but could he have been a bit more aggressive in squeezing Verstappen before the braking zone?

This move was essential for Verstappen’s win. A front row lock out is such a dangerous advantage for a team because it gives them the strategic options to cover off the nearest threat in the pitstop phase.
